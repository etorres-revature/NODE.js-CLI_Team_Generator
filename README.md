### Technologies Used 

#### :sparkler: JavaScript :sparkler:

**JavaScript (JS)** is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (along with HTML and CSS). It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.  JS is a multi-faceted, scripting language that provides versatility through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, among others.

#### :globe_with_meridians: NODE.js :globe_with_meridians:

**NODE.js** is an open-source, corss-platform JavaScript runtime environment that execute JavaScript code outside a web browser.  NODE.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.  NODE.js represents a "Javascript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different programming languages for server- and client-side scripts.
